Write a program which:
• creates a random number between 1 and 10
• start a loop
• inputs a guess from the user
• check that the guess is valid i.e. it is between 1
and 10
• if it isn't the program prints invalid guess
• the guess is then compared to the random
number and tells you Win , Low or High
• a win exits the loop
